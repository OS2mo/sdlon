# About the Scripts

You have reached the `scripts` folder of the SD integration - a place
where you should watch your step. The scripts in this folder are a
collection of one-off scripts used to fixed various problems that occurred
due to bugs etc. in integrations writing data to MO. They scripts are NOT meant
to be generic scripts that you can just run without careful thought - so use
them with care and make sure you have read the code thoroughly before running
them.

Despite the above, the scripts are under version control in this repo since
that is preferred over having them lying around on random developers laptops
as they may serve as inspiration for more one-off scripts to come in the
future.
